Replace paths relevant to your situation but they can all be found in the Honeycomb\Honey\Varroa\src\certs\debug_cert folder. Map as needed.

Once created a cert copy the "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----" to "-----END CERTIFICATE-----" output in the console and replace over the localhost.crt file. Then install the crt file on the local machine under "Trusted Root Certification Authorities".
